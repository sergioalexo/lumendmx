# The lighting engine

`src-tauri/src/engine/` computes what actually goes out on the wire: it merges
the programmer and every running playback into a final per-universe buffer at
a fixed 44Hz, independent of the UI's frame rate.

## Why channel-based, not fixture/attribute-based

The engine's `Layer` type (`state.rs`) only knows about `(universe, channel)
-> value`. Resolving "fixture 3's red channel" into an actual DMX address is
static configuration data (the fixture library + patch), not timing-critical,
so that resolution stays in the frontend, which already has the fixture
library (`src/lib/fixtures/`) — duplicating it in Rust would just be a second
copy to keep in sync. Only the *resolved* result crosses into Rust:

- `engine_set_htp_channels(universe, channels)` — which channels merge via HTP
  (a fixture's dimmer channel) vs LTP (everything else). Recomputed and pushed
  whenever the patch or fixture library changes (`useShowStore.ts`'s
  `syncEnginePatch`).
- `engine_set_patch_index(entries)` — fixture number -> (universe, intensity
  channel), what the command line's `1 THRU 8 @ 50` resolves against. Fixture
  numbers are just 1-based patch order for now; real fixture ID assignment is
  Phase 4's Patch screen.

## Merge model

`merge::merge_universe` (see its module docs and tests): intensity channels
are HTP (max across every layer, regardless of priority); everything else is
LTP (the highest-priority layer with an entry for that channel wins outright).
The programmer's priority is `i64::MAX`, so "programmer > playbacks" is just a
consequence of the general rule, not a special case.

## Playback layers

Every triggered Scene/Chase/FX (`src/store/useLibraryStore.ts`'s `trigger`,
or the Live AI console) becomes one playback layer
(`legacy_playback::RunningPlayback`), advanced every tick instead of on its
own `setTimeout` — this is what BUILD_PLAN Phase 3 means by "retire
chaseEngine.ts; replace it with a Rust playback that's frame-accurate". Two
playbacks that touch the same channel now go through the same HTP/LTP merge
as everything else, instead of racing to call `applyPatch` last the way the
old runner did.

A non-looping playback (a "Scene") keeps its last values live after it
finishes ticking — matching `LightAsset`'s own "Scenes always apply steps[0]
once" contract (a static look that persists) rather than reverting once its
`RunningPlayback` stops. `stop_asset`/re-triggering the same id is what
actually removes a layer.

## Groups and presets (Phase 5)

- `engine::groups::GroupStore`: a named, persistent set of fixture numbers.
  The command line's `GROUP N` selection term resolves against these (see
  `SelectionExpr::resolve`'s `groups` parameter).
- `engine::presets::PresetStore`: a named set of *attribute* values (e.g.
  "red" -> 200.0), one store shared across all seven families
  (Intensity/Colour/Position/Beam/BeamFx/Framing/Effect), filterable by
  family. Recording reads each target fixture's currently-rendered value via
  `merge_universe`; applying resolves attribute -> channel fresh per target
  fixture through `PatchIndexEntry.attribute_channels`, so the same preset
  can apply to any fixture with matching attributes — not just the one it
  was recorded from, and never a snapshot copied into whatever uses it. See
  DECISIONS.md for what a preset apply and a "group master" fader are (and
  aren't).

## Cuelists and playback (Phase 6)

- `engine::cues::{Cuelist, Cue, CueValue}`: a cuelist is a `Vec<Cue>` kept
  sorted by (possibly decimal) cue number. A cue's value per channel is
  either `Literal(f32)` or `Preset { preset_id, attribute }` — the latter
  reuses `apply_preset`'s "resolve by id, never copy" pattern, so updating a
  preset changes every cue that references it, immediately, with no
  propagation step. `resolve_cue_state` computes a cue's effective state
  fresh on every call: with `tracking` on, it layers cues `0..=index`
  (a later cue's value for the same channel wins); with tracking off, just
  the cue's own values. This is deliberately *not* cached — editing an
  earlier cue immediately changes what every later cue tracks in.
- `engine::playback::PlaybackRuntime`: a running instance of a cuelist —
  GO/Back/Release, a time-based crossfade (`FaderMode::IntensityMaster`,
  the fader scales only HTP/intensity channels) or a manual crossfade
  fader (`FaderMode::Crossfade`), and for a `CuelistKind::Chase`, BPM-driven
  auto-advance (Forward/Bounce/Random). Multiple playbacks can run the same
  or different cuelists concurrently — `EngineManager::create_playback`
  hands out a fresh id and priority per slot.
- Cue playbacks render into `EngineState.playbacks` — the **same** map
  legacy Scene/Chase/FX assets use — keyed by `"cue-playback-{id}"` instead
  of the legacy asset's own id, so both go through identical HTP/LTP merge
  logic with no separate code path. A `CuelistKind::Override` playback gets
  a priority at or above `manager::OVERRIDE_PRIORITY_BASE`
  (1,000,000,000), below the programmer's `i64::MAX` but above every
  standard/chase playback and legacy asset, so it always wins LTP
  regardless of trigger order.
- `CuelistKind::Submaster`: no GO/cue-stepping; `create_playback` puts it on
  cue 0 immediately and its fader directly scales that (tracked) state.
  `CuelistKind::Timecode` behaves like `Standard` (manual GO only) — nothing
  drives it from an external clock yet; LTC/MTC input is Phase 8.
- The command line's `RECORD CUE`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE CUE`/`NEXT`/`PREV` are
  now live: they operate against whichever cuelist
  `engine_set_current_cuelist` last selected (the Cuelists tab calls this
  when you open a cuelist) and, for `RECORD CUE`, the command line's own
  selection + `TIME` value (`RECORD CUE`'s fade-in/out both come from the
  last `TIME n` — there's no separate in/out syntax). `UPDATE` re-captures
  whichever cue number `RECORD CUE` last touched (the grammar gives it no
  number of its own). `NEXT`/`PREV` step the first playback slot attached
  to the current cuelist; if none exists yet, they return a clear error
  rather than silently doing nothing. `COPY`/`MOVE` still parse (and are
  unit-tested) but stay unimplemented — the existing grammar gives them no
  target-number argument, and inventing one isn't this phase's call to
  make; see DECISIONS.md.
- `CueDto`/`CuelistDto`/`CueValueEntry` flatten `Cue.values`'s
  `HashMap<(u32,u16), CueValue>` into a plain list crossing the Tauri
  boundary, the same reason `PatchIndexEntry` exists — JSON object keys
  must be strings, and a `(universe, channel)` tuple isn't one.

## What isn't here yet

- **An attribute encoder bar / full manual programmer UI**: `CommandLine.tsx`
  is the only manual programmer surface today. The Onyx-style attribute bar
  (BUILD_PLAN section 2) is progressive UI work built up as later phases add
  the window types it needs.
- **DMX input merged into output**: `output::input` receives and decodes
  Art-Net/sACN but doesn't feed it into this engine's merge — see
  docs/OUTPUT.md's scope note.
