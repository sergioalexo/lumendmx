# On-rig / on-desktop checks

Things a coding agent can't verify from here — either because they need the
physical rig (see `FIXTURES.md`), or because they need the actual built
desktop app rather than the browser-only dev preview this environment can
drive. Check these off by hand; each entry says which phase added it.

## Phase 1 — Foundations

- [ ] **New/Open/Save/Save As dialogs.** These use native file dialogs (`rfd`
      crate) that only work inside a real Tauri window — the sandboxed browser
      preview used during development can't invoke them (calls fail with
      "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'invoke')", which is
      expected and handled gracefully). In the built app: create a show with a
      couple of patched fixtures, Save, quit, relaunch, Open it back up, and
      confirm the patch reappears.
- [ ] **Autosave.** Leave the app open with an unsaved change for a couple of
      minutes and confirm files appear under the OS app-data directory at
      `LumenDMX/autosave/<show id>/` (Windows: `%APPDATA%/com.pashchenkos.lumendmx/`),
      and that only the 10 most recent are kept.

## Phase 2 — Multi-universe output engine

- [ ] **FTDI flicker regression check.** The output thread was generalized
      from a single hardcoded engine into `output::runner::UniverseOutput` +
      `output::ftdi::FtdiDriver`. The break/MAB timing, thread priority, and
      pacing are unchanged by inspection (see docs/OUTPUT.md), but re-run the
      original zero-flicker check on the real rig (COM9, 4 pars) before
      trusting it on a show.
- [ ] **Art-Net interop.** Point a real Art-Net node (or a software one like
      QLC+ or an Art-Net-to-sACN bridge) or Wireshark at a universe configured
      as Art-Net in Setup and confirm frames arrive with the right net/subnet/
      universe and channel values. Also try ArtPoll discovery against that node.
- [ ] **sACN interop.** Point sACNView (or another sACN receiver/viewer) at a
      universe configured as sACN in Setup (try both multicast and unicast)
      and confirm the universe number, priority, and channel values are right.
- [ ] **Enttec DMX USB Pro.** No physical Pro widget was available to build
      this against — it's implemented from the documented "Send DMX Packet"
      protocol only. Needs a real Pro (or Pro Mk2) widget to confirm the frame
      format is accepted and outputs correctly. The Mk2's second universe
      (`universeIndex: 1`) is deliberately unimplemented (returns an error)
      until someone can confirm its port-select framing on real hardware.
- [ ] **4 simultaneous universes.** Per the phase's own "done when": run 4
      universes at once (e.g. FTDI + Art-Net + sACN + a second Art-Net
      universe) and confirm all four keep outputting correctly under load.
- [ ] **DMX input.** `output::input::DmxInputManager` receives and decodes
      Art-Net/sACN input (unit-tested for the decode logic) but has no UI yet
      and isn't merged into any output — there's nothing to check on the rig
      for this one until Phase 3 (merge) and Phase 12 (DMX monitor UI) exist.

## Phase 3 — Engine core

- [ ] **No stutter under UI load.** Per the phase's own "done when": freeze
      the UI thread for ~2s (e.g. a heavy re-render or a breakpoint) and
      confirm the FTDI rig's output doesn't glitch — the 44Hz engine tick
      runs on its own thread, independent of the UI, but this needs an actual
      running app + rig to confirm, not just code inspection.
- [ ] **Command line against the real patch.** Patch the 4 pars, then try
      `1 THRU 4 @ FULL`, `1 THRU 4 @ 0`, and confirm all four actually go to
      full/zero on the rig, not just that the command reports success.
- [ ] **Two overlapping triggered Scenes on the real rig.** Trigger two
      Scenes that both touch the same par's dimmer and a color channel;
      confirm dimmer shows the brighter one (HTP) and color shows whichever
      was triggered more recently (LTP), matching engine::merge's tests.

## Phase 4 — Fixture library and patch

- [ ] **Patch a real OFL moving head.** Fetch a real fixture's OFL JSON
      (there's no moving head on this rig — see FIXTURES.md), import it via
      "Import OFL", patch it, and confirm dimmer/pan/tilt/color-wheel/gobo
      channels actually move the fixture correctly — the importer's own
      correctness is unit-tested, but real hardware interpreting the
      resulting channel values is not.
- [ ] **Re-verify the 4 pars after the patch-panel rewrite.** The live
      channel display now reads per-universe engine frames instead of the
      old single-universe buffer read; confirm the pars' sliders/color
      presets still drive real DMX output correctly on the rig.
- [ ] **Try a QLC+ `.qxf` import** against a real fixture file from QLC+'s
      own fixture repository (not just this project's test fixture) to
      catch any real-world `.qxf` quirk the unit tests didn't cover.

## Phase 5 — Groups, presets, palettes

- [ ] **Record and apply a real Colour preset on the 4 pars.** Pick a color
      with the wheel, record it, then apply it to a different par than the
      one it was recorded from, and confirm the color actually matches (the
      attribute->channel resolution per target fixture is the part that
      can't be fully proven without real hardware to look at).
- [ ] **Group master fader** on a real group of the 4 pars — confirm moving
      the slider dims them together, and that it behaves like `GROUP N @
      value` (an immediate set, not a live-riding scale) as documented in
      DECISIONS.md, not something more than that.

## Phase 6 — Cuelists, playback

- [ ] **Record and step through a real Standard cuelist on the 4 pars.**
      Select fixtures via the command line or the Cuelists tab's picker, set
      a look, `RECORD CUE 1`, change the look, `RECORD CUE 2`, add a playback
      from the Cuelists tab, and confirm `NEXT`/GO actually crossfades the
      real par output over the recorded fade time — the crossfade math is
      unit-tested, but real DMX output on the wire over that fade is not.
- [ ] **Two playbacks on the same fixtures, one an Override cuelist.**
      Confirm the Override playback's LTP channels always win over the
      Standard one regardless of which was triggered more recently, matching
      `OVERRIDE_PRIORITY_BASE`'s intent — this is unit-tested against the
      merge logic in isolation but not against two real concurrent
      `PlaybackRuntime`s ticking on the live engine thread.
- [ ] **Chase auto-advance and tap-tempo on the real rig.** Create a Chase
      cuelist across the 4 pars, add a playback, and confirm the BPM-driven
      auto-advance actually paces visibly correct on real hardware, and that
      `PlaybackBar`'s tap-tempo button converges to a sensible BPM after a
      few taps (its averaging window and click-timestamp math haven't been
      exercised outside this browser-preview environment's `performance.now`).
- [ ] **Submaster fader behavior on a real fixture.** Confirm a Submaster
      playback's fader directly scales its recorded (tracked) look on real
      output, with no GO-stepping, as intended.
