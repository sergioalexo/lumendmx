# Fixture library

One JSON file per fixture. Every file here is bundled into the app automatically
(no registration step needed) and shows up in the Fixture Patch panel's picker.

## Contributing a fixture

1. Copy `generic-6color-par.json` as a starting point.
2. Filename = the fixture's `id` (kebab-case), e.g. `chauvet-slimpar-q6.json`.
3. Fill in the fields below from the fixture's manual.
4. Load the app -- the Fixture Patch panel validates the file and will print
   errors to the browser/devtools console if something's missing.

You can also import a fixture JSON file at runtime without a PR, from the
"Import fixture JSON" button in the Fixture Patch panel -- useful for testing a
definition, or for a one-off fixture you don't want to upstream. The patch
panel also has "Import OFL" (an [Open Fixture Library](https://open-fixture-library.org/)
JSON file, e.g. downloaded from its GitHub repo) and "Import QLC+ (.qxf)"
(a [QLC+](https://www.qlcplus.org/) fixture definition), which convert into
this same schema -- and "New fixture"/"Edit fixture", a UI editor for
building or tweaking a definition by hand with the same validation. See
docs/FIXTURES_SCHEMA.md for how those importers map their formats onto the
fields below.

## Schema

```jsonc
{
  "id": "manufacturer-model-slug",   // unique, matches the filename
  "manufacturer": "Manufacturer",
  "model": "Model Name",
  "type": "LED Par",                 // freeform: "LED Par", "Moving Head", "Strobe", etc.
  "notes": "optional freeform notes",
  "modes": [
    {
      "name": "10-Channel Mode",
      "channelCount": 10,
      "channels": [
        { "offset": 1, "type": "dimmer", "label": "Dimmer" },
        { "offset": 2, "type": "red" }
        // ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

A fixture can list multiple `modes` (e.g. a 6-channel mode and a 10-channel mode)
-- the person patching it in the app picks one when they add it to their rig.

### Channel `type`

One of: `dimmer`, `red`, `green`, `blue`, `white`, `amber`, `uv`, `cyan`,
`magenta`, `yellow`, `strobe`, `function`, `speed`, `pan`, `tilt`, `colorwheel`,
`gobo`, `macro`, `generic`, `prism`, `focus`, `zoom`, `iris`, `frost`,
`control`, `reset`, `lamp`, `nofunction`. `label` overrides the display name
if you want something more specific than the type (e.g. `"UV"` instead of
`"uv"`).

### Optional fields (16-bit, capabilities, multi-cell, physical)

A channel can also carry:

- `fineOffset`: the offset of this channel's fine/LSB pair, for a 16-bit
  (coarse + fine) channel — `offset` is the coarse/MSB one.
- `cell`: which repeated segment this channel belongs to, for a fixture with
  multiple individually-controllable pixels/cells. This is just enough to
  group a multi-cell fixture's channels for patching; full pixel-map
  addressing is a separate, later feature (see BUILD_PLAN Phase 7).
- `capabilities`: for a channel whose DMX range actually subdivides into
  different behaviors (a strobe that's "open" below 10 and strobes at an
  increasing rate above it; a color/gobo wheel's discrete slots), a list of
  `{ dmxRange: [min, max], type, label?, color?, image?, physicalRange? }`.
  Leave this out for a channel that does one thing across its whole range —
  `type` alone covers that, same as before.
- `physicalRange`: `{ min, max, unit }` (`unit` is `"deg"`, `"%"`, `"hz"`, or
  `"s"`) — a physical quantity the channel sweeps across its range, e.g. a
  pan channel's `{min: 0, max: 540, unit: "deg"}`. Purely descriptive today.

A `FixtureDefinition` can also carry a top-level `physical` object:
`{ weightKg?, dimensionsMm?: [w,h,d], powerW?, beamAngleDeg?: [min,max] }`.

None of this is required — `generic-6color-par.json` only uses `capabilities`
on its Strobe/Function channels as an example; everything else stays in the
original simple `type`-only form.

### `function`-type channels (auto-program / mode-select channels)

Cheap fixtures very often have a channel where low values mean "listen to my
other DMX channels" and higher values switch into built-in auto-chases,
sound-reactive modes, etc. If you don't declare this, a patched fixture can
silently ignore the DMX you're sending it. Use `manualRange` and `defaultValue`
to describe and default it:

```jsonc
{
  "offset": 9,
  "type": "function",
  "manualRange": [0, 50],   // the range that means "plain DMX control"
  "defaultValue": 0,        // written automatically when the fixture is patched
  "notes": "051-100 = built-in color presets, 101+ = auto chases, etc."
}
```

The app writes `defaultValue` for every such channel the moment a fixture is
added to the patch, so it starts out obeying the DMX you send it instead of
running its own program.
